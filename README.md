# Strategic War Card Game

Based on the [War card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)), these rules have been updated to add strategy to the game.

## Rules

### Setup
- 2 Player game.
- Randomly shuffle a standard 52-card deck.
- Split the deck evenly among the players.

### Gameplay

#### Deck and Hand
- Players always have 3 cards in their hand, drawing from their own deck. If a player can't draw, continue play until their hand runs out.
- The game ends when once either player has no cards left in their deck and hand.

#### Battle
- Each player picks one card from their hand to play face down.
- Flip the cards over, the highest card wins the pile. Adding the cards to the bottom of their deck.
- In the event of a tie, players start a war.

### War
- A war is started when both players play a card of the same value.
- Each player adds the rest of their hand to the pile.
- Draw cards until one player draws a higher card than the other, winning the war.
- The winner of the war receives all the cards in the pile. Adding them to the bottom of their deck.
- If a player can no longer draw, they lose the war by "attrition," and the game is over.
